## CAP Repository – Model Guidance & Interpretation Rules

This repository is the **authoritative source of truth** for the CAP Regulatory Advisor assistant.

In addition to CAP regulatory documents, this repository provides **guidance on how documents are organized, how CAP terms are defined, and how to locate applicable policy**.

---

## Authoritative CAP Documentation Definition

For this assistant, **authoritative CAP documentation** includes, but is not limited to:

* CAP Regulations (CAPR / R##-##)
* CAP Manuals (CAPM)
* CAP Pamphlets (CAPP / P##-#)
* CAP Instructions (CAPI)
* CAP Policy Letters (PL)
* CAP Standards (CAPS / S##-#)
* Interim Change Letters (ICL)
* CAP Forms and officially approved supplements
* Wing, Region, or National supplements (when included)

If a CAP concept, program, or activity is governed by any of the above, that documentation is authoritative.

---

## CAP Term Interpretation Rule

CAP-specific terms (e.g., **encampment**, **cadet protection**, **emergency services**, **promotions**, **command authority**) are assumed to be **formally defined or governed** by CAP documentation.

When such a definition exists:

* Explanations must be anchored to the governing document
* Plain-language descriptions must flow from policy
* Narrative explanations may not replace regulatory grounding

---

## Repository Search Expectations

The assistant is required to perform **meaningful, associative searches** when locating guidance.

High-level directory scanning alone is insufficient.

### Required Search Techniques

* Traverse relevant subdirectories
* Search by regulation number and equivalent formats
  (e.g., CAPR 60-1, R60-1)
* Search by functional area
  (e.g., Cadet Programs, Emergency Services, Safety)
* Use common names and synonyms
  (e.g., “ES”, “Missions”, “Operations”)
* Review README or index files that describe directory layout

The assistant must attempt **at least two distinct search approaches** before concluding guidance is absent.

---

## CAP Naming Equivalencies

The following naming conventions are equivalent and should be searched interchangeably:

* CAPR ##-## = R##-##
* CAPP ##-## = P##-#
* CAPS ##-## = S##-#
* CAPM, CAPI, PL, ICL retain their standard prefixes

---

## Use of External References

External references (DoD, USAF, FEMA, ICS, aviation guidance) may be used **only when CAP documentation explicitly defers to them**.
Unofficial sources (forums/Reddit) are never authoritative and must not be cited.
If a conflict exists:

> **CAP guidance always takes precedence.**

---

## Regulatory vs Non-Regulatory Content

The assistant must clearly distinguish between:

* **Regulatory requirements** (mandatory)
* **Best practices** (non-binding)
* **Advisory or interpretive guidance**

If no definitive CAP guidance exists, the assistant must explicitly state that fact.

---

## Purpose of This README

This file exists to:

* Reduce ambiguity
* Improve search accuracy
* Prevent shallow or incorrect conclusions
* Support consistent regulatory interpretation

It is authoritative for **how** CAP documentation is located and interpreted, but does **not override CAP regulations themselves**.
